       " 'My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.\\nI have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!\\nI never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.\\n\\niPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.\\n\\nI was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.\\n\\nDisplay quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.\\nI would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.\\n\\nYou can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.\\n\\nSpeakers are Great.\\n\\nBattery life is better than my previous devices,\\niOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.\\nNOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.\\n\\nFor the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.\\n\\nBut other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.\\nTruly worth it.\\n',\n",
       " \"Apple Marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone. I have been on Android for almost inception of phones and switching to iPhone is just a pain.\\n\\n1. No guide or help to transfer your critical data(Move to iOS doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer.\\nIf you want to buy, go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there.\\n2. Over hyped phone, nothing great i have found in the phone. May be i will find it better.\\n3. Total stuck with ecosystem.\\n4. At 90K they don't provide charger and are selling the same as extra. Total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe.\\n\\nI am not a happy customer till now!
